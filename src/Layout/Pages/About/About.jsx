            <p><span className="text-2xl ">TACH Mission Statement: </span>For those new to tech careers, there is a lot of misconception about what a tech conference is and why they should be interested and attend. The name conjures images of people dressed in business formal, listening to long and boring presentations on annual revenue. Perhaps when most people think of conferences, it’s the academic style paper sharing conference which can be inaccessible to anyone not from an academic background. Maybe that’s why one of the UK’s Data Science events went with calling itself the Data Science Festival, instead of the Data Science Conference.</p><br /><br />
            <p>Tech conferences tend to be fun — and just to be clear, most of them have no dress code whatsoever (casual super welcome) and are very welcoming to people from all levels of their careers. A lot of tech conferences also have a focus on the social and ‘fun’ side instead of just focusing on the talks & learning.</p><br /><br />

                <h1>CV Boosting & Passion Proving</h1>
                <p>As entry-level jobs in tech are becoming more competitive than ever before, standing out has become more challenging than ever. Attending conferences shows that you’re passionate and interested in technology — rather than just chasing the latest buzzwords and promise of a high salary. Getting involved in the technical communities relevant to your field can be an extra nudge to convince the hiring team that you’re the right choice.</p>
